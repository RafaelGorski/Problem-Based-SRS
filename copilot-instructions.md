# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Problem-Based SRS

## Project Overview
This repository provides standalone prompts and guidance for following a Problem-Based Software Requirements Specification (SRS) methodology. The focus is on enabling AI-assisted requirements engineering through structured, problem-first approaches.

## Core Principles
1. **Problem-First Thinking**: Always identify the problem before proposing solutions
2. **Lightweight Methodology**: Favor simplicity over complex frameworks
3. **AI-Native Design**: Content designed for consumption by AI agents
4. **Practical Guidance**: Focus on actionable prompts and templates

## When Working on This Repository

### Content Creation
- Write prompts that are clear, structured, and self-contained
- Ensure prompts can be used independently without requiring the full repository context
- Focus on guiding users through problem identification before solution design
- Include examples that demonstrate real-world scenarios

### Documentation
- Keep documentation concise and scannable
- Use markdown formatting effectively (headers, lists, code blocks)
- Provide context for why, not just what or how
- Include references to relevant SRS standards (IEEE 830, etc.) where appropriate

### File Organization
- Prompts should be organized by requirements phase (discovery, analysis, specification, etc.)
- Templates should be separate from instructional content
- Examples should clearly demonstrate the intended use case

### Code Style
- This is primarily a documentation repository
- Any code examples should be language-agnostic where possible
- Use clear, readable formatting in examples

## Terminology
- **SRS**: Software Requirements Specification
- **Problem-Based**: Requirements methodology that starts with problem identification
- **Prompt**: A structured instruction designed for AI agent consumption
- **AI Agent**: Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, or similar assistants

## Quality Standards
- Accuracy in requirements engineering concepts
- Clarity in prompt instructions
- Completeness in examples and templates
- Consistency in structure and formatting
