# Problem-Based SRS Methodology

## Overview

The Problem-Based Software Requirements Specification (SRS) methodology focuses on understanding and documenting software requirements through a problem-oriented approach. This methodology emphasizes identifying real problems before proposing solutions, ensuring that requirements are grounded in actual user needs and business objectives.

## Core Principles

1. **Problem-First Thinking**: Start with the problem, not the solution
2. **Context Awareness**: Understand the environment and constraints
3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve all relevant stakeholders early
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously validate and refine requirements
5. **Traceability**: Maintain clear links from problems to requirements to solutions

## Methodology Phases

### Phase 1: Problem Identification and Analysis

**Objective**: Clearly identify and understand the problems that need to be solved.

**Activities**:
- Identify stakeholders and their pain points
- Document current state and challenges
- Analyze root causes of problems
- Prioritize problems based on impact and urgency

**Outputs**:
- Problem statement document
- Stakeholder analysis
- Problem priority matrix

### Phase 2: Requirements Elicitation

**Objective**: Gather and document what the system must do to solve the identified problems.

**Activities**:
- Conduct stakeholder interviews
- Facilitate workshops and brainstorming sessions
- Observe current workflows
- Analyze existing systems and documentation
- Document functional and non-functional requirements

**Outputs**:
- Requirements list
- User stories or use cases
- Acceptance criteria

### Phase 3: Requirements Specification

**Objective**: Document requirements in a clear, complete, and unambiguous manner.

**Activities**:
- Structure requirements logically
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Document constraints and dependencies
- Specify quality attributes (performance, security, usability)
- Create requirements traceability matrix

**Outputs**:
- Formal SRS document
- Requirements traceability matrix
- Data models and diagrams

### Phase 4: Requirements Validation

**Objective**: Ensure requirements are correct, complete, and achievable.

**Activities**:
- Review requirements with stakeholders
- Verify requirements against problems
- Check for completeness, consistency, and feasibility
- Validate acceptance criteria
- Obtain stakeholder sign-off

**Outputs**:
- Validated requirements document
- Stakeholder approval records
- Issue and resolution log

## Best Practices

1. **Start with "Why"**: Always articulate why a requirement exists
2. **Keep it Simple**: Use clear, jargon-free language
3. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague terms like "user-friendly" or "fast"
4. **Stay Traceable**: Link every requirement back to a problem or objective
5. **Iterate Early**: Validate assumptions as soon as possible
6. **Document Context**: Include constraints, assumptions, and dependencies

## Integration with AI Agents

This methodology is designed to work seamlessly with AI-powered development tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude Code. The prompts in this repository provide structured guidance for each phase, enabling AI agents to:

- Assist in problem analysis
- Generate requirement templates
- Suggest validation criteria
- Create documentation drafts
- Maintain traceability
